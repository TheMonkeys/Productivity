* Package Applications for PhoneGap Build
* Upload Applications to PhoneGap Build
* Listen for notification from PhoneGap Build 
* Download and install application on Android Devices.
* Download and install application on IOS Devices.

#NOTE your application will have to be setup to be created from zip instead of a github repository.


An optional part of the ANT build process relies on Transporter Chief, which is available here:

Basically in development with the ANT script and transporter Chief you have the option of pushing
new content to PGB, waiting for it to build, downloading new app, and installing it on an attached 
iOS device. 

An optional part of the ANT build process relies on the Android SDK

Basically in development with the ANT script and the SDK tool ADB you have the option of pushing
